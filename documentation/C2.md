Do High-H People Flock Together?	89

attractiveness is similar to their own. Of course, attractiveness is not the only characteristic that people desire in a mate, so high levels of other characteristics can compensate for lower attract- iveness, and vice versa. Still, physicd attractivenes5 iS apparently an important part of a person's overall “mate value” as perceived by others.
Physical attractiveness is a characteristic that pretty much everyone desires in a mate—other things being equal, most people want a mate who is physicdly attractive. But not all characteristics work this way. For some traits, there is no universally agreed “bet- ter” direction, and for most of those traits people prefer a mate who is similar to themselves. Consider religiosity: religious people want religious mates, and people who aren't religious want mates who aren't religious either. You've probably noticed that hard-core atheists rarely marry religious fundamentalists. Such a marriage would make good materid for a television sitcom, but it prob- ably wouldn't work. Researchers consistently find that in most marriages, spouses are similar in their level of religiosity.2 And of course, highly religious people prefer highly religious mates of the same religion.3
When it comes to the matching of romantic partners, polit- ical attitudes are a lot like religious beliefs. People with le9-wing attitudes tend to pair off with each other, and so do people with right-wing political attitudes. Couples such as the now-separated Maria Shriver and Arnold Schwarzenegger—she a Democrat, he a Republican—are much less common than couple5 who have similar political orientations. The similarity between spouses for political ideology is dmost as strong as for religiosity.

Similarity—and Perceived Similarity—in Friends
So much for attitudes. But what about personality? Are spouses similar in personality traits in the sense described in this book? Or do opposites attract? Or is matching completely random? And— in case we become too narrowly focused on romantic relation- ships—what about friends? Do we generally choose friends whose personalities are similar, on bdance, to our own? Or do we pick friends who are opposite to us in some aspects of personality, as if we were seeking friends whose personalities would complement our own?
In the early 2000s, we did a series of research projects that gave us a great ded of interesting data on these questions. As mentioned in the previous chapter, we collected lots of person- ality data from pairs of closely acquainted people—usually pairs of close friends, sometimes boyfriend/girlfriend couples. As you'll recall, we found fairly high correlations between self-reports and observer reports of the six personality factors. This meant that the students tended to agree with each other in their (independent) assessments of each other's personalities.
Eventually, we redized that these data could dso be used to examine the topic of similarity in personality between friends or romantic partners. Remember that in these studies, the partici- pants in each pair completed the personality inventory twice: once to describe their own personality, and once to describe the other person's persondity. Suppose that two friends, Jack and Jill, are participants in our study. First Jack and Jill each provide self-reports using our personality inventory; then each provides observer reports of the other person usiag the same inventory. To find out how much the self-reports on a given trait agree with

the observer reports, we simply compare /ack's self-reports with Jill's observer reports about Jack, and vice versa (see Figure 6-1).
But if we want to know how similar our participants are on a given trait, we will instead compare /ack's self-reports and Jill's self-reports (see Figure 6-2). This is the same similarity we were t&king about earlier in this chapter—how similar two friends are in a given personality trait.'
And finally, if we want to know how similar our participants seem to think they are to each other on a given trait, we compare Jack's self-report with Jack's observer report about Jill, and vice versa. These correlations tell us how similar /ack thinbs Jill is to him, or how much similarity is implicitly “perceived” or “assumed” by Jack (see Figure 6—3). That is, even though we haven't explicitly asked /ack about how similar he and /ill are, these correlations indicate how much his report about Jill's persondity resembles his report about his own person¥ity.

FIGUREó—3	Perceived Similarity

We searched the person¥ity literature for any previous inves- tigations on similarity and perceived similarity. But we couldn't find many, and the few that existed hadn't found much similar- ity in personality between friends, or even between spouses, and hadn't found much assumed or perceived similarity either. So we realized that we could learn something new from our data.
When we looked at the correlations between the self-reports
of the two friends of each pair, we found that the friends were usudly somewhat similar in two of the HEXACO factors: H and
O. The degree of similarity was only modest: the correlations were about .25 for both factors.‘ But for the other four factors, there was very little similarity.
What this meant was that the more genuine and unassuming university students (those high in H) tended to find each other as friends—at least at a somewhat higher-than-chance level—and that the more devious and pretentious university students (those low in H) tended to do the same. Likewise, the more inquisitive and complex university students (those high in O) dso tended (somewhat) to attract each other as friends, a5 did the more con- ventions and unimaginative university students (those low in O). Maybe this doesn't sound so surprising, but what makes these results so interesting is that for the other four person¥ity factors, this tendency was much weaker. For those other dimensions, it was as if the friend pairs were forming almost at random.'
The results were even more striking when we examined the
amount of perceived similarity between friends, by checking the correlations between people's self-reports and their observer reports about their friends: people perceived their friends as being quite similar to them in the H  and O factors, with correlations

around .40 (a bit higher for H and a bit lower for O). In other words, the perceived similarity between friends for H and O was even greater than the arrua/ similarity. But for the other four fac- tors, there was no such perceived similarity.
Putting these two sets of findings together, we can say that friends are somewhat similar in their levels of H and O—but not as similar as they apparently thinl: they are. To some extent, friends are correct in perceiving some similarity between them- selves in the H and O factors. But they dso tend to perceive more similarity than there redly i5. And for the other four factors, the friends (on average) are neither similar nor opposite, nor do they see each other as similar or opposite.

Personality, Values, and Relationships
These findings still left us with a question: Why these two factors? Why should friends be similar (and perceive themselves to be even more similar) on these two aspects of personality, and only on these two? A couple of years later, we had some ideas and a good opportunity to test them. With our graduate students, Julie Pozzebon and Beth Visser, we began a study of people's “personal values” in relation to the HEXACO personality factors. Personal values is one of the few topic5 in psychology that can be said to be uniquely human. Researchers can study learning, or percep- tion, or motivation, or intelligence, or even personality in many other non-human animals. For example, there are many scien- tific reports about “personality” traits for such animals as chim- panzees, dogs, various kinds of fish and birds, and octopuses. Apparently, the personality traits of individuals in those kinds

of animals can be measured reliably; furthermore, the di4erences between individuds are stable across time and are genetically inherited. By contrast, humans seem to be the only animals to have values  ideals about which goals ought to matter in life. By investigating values, we would be able to test our ideas about why some personality traits exhibit similarity and perceived simi- larity between friends.
What are the main differences among people in their per- sond values? Researchers have found two broad dimensions: the first factor represents the relative importance one places on indi- viduality and novelty as opposed to conformity and tradition; the second represents the relative importance one places on equality and the welfare of others as opposed to one's own power, wealth, and success.8 In other words, there are two main ways in which people can di4er from one another in their values: one way is that some people prefer independence and change whereas others want to respect authority and preserve tradition; the other is that some people emphasize caring and sharing whereas others are con- cerned only with their own gain.
You can probably predict how these two dimensions of values
were related to the major dimensions of personality: the first was related to the O factor, the second to the H factor. Apparently, people's values are a function of their personalities, but mainly just these two aspects of personality, as the relations with the other four persondity factors were weak. So we had findly found an important feature shared by H and O but not by the other four HEXACO factors: the H and O factors, much more than the others, underlie our choices regarding which goals are worth pur- suing throughout one's life.

But if the link with values is what explains why friends are similar (and see themselves as similar) in H and O, we should also find similarity (and perceived similarity) for the values dimensions. We checked this out, and sure enough, the pattern of similarity and perceived similarity for the value dimensions was the same as we had found for the H and O factors. People prefer to associate with those who have similar vdues, and this is probably because these values are so important to one's sense of identity. We define ourselves, in part, in terms of how we think people should relate to one another and to the broader society. Because our persond value system is an important part of who we are, it's an important element in forming our friendships and romantic relationships.'
We're not saying that most people consciously decide to start or to continue their relationships by thinking, “Well, this person appears to have values similar to mine, therefore I will choose this person as my friend.” Not many people operate in this way. Our point instead is that people simply find that they like each other better when they're on the same wavelength about the things that matter in life, even though they don't necessarily realize that this is influencing their liking for each other.
This explanation also fits neatly with another finding about perceived similarity. People should see their friends or romantic partners as similar to themselves, because those are close, mean- ingful relationships. In contrast, people shouldn't see so much similarity in other people—say, co-workers or classmates or neighbours—with whom they are fairly well acquainted but not particularly close. And people shouldn't see much similarity either in people whose personalities they can observe but with whom

there isn't any relationship at dl, such as fictiond characters. We tested these ideas out in a couple of studies. In the first, we found that the level of perceived similarity in H and O was much lower for co-workers and classmates and neighbours than for close frienA and romantic partners. In the second, we found that there was no perceived similarity at all when we asked our participants to report on the person¥ities of two familiar television characters (specifically, Ross and Rachel from Friends, a popular US sitcom of the 2000s).
All of these results have an interesting practical implication. According to an old Korean saying, we should “look at the friends to learn about the person.” Our results suggest that this proverb is true—if we mean the H and O factors of personality, and the vdues associated with those factors. We could probably get a fairly good idea of a person's levels of H and O by averaging that per- son's closest friends' levels of each factor.10 And we could get an even more accurate idea by averaging the levels of H and O that the person aPributes to his or her friends.
The links between personality and values help us understand why friends tend to be similar—and to perceive each other as similar—in the H and O factors of personality. Those results also open the door to a couple of other domains in which the H and O factor5 are implicated: politics and religion. These are the topics of the next two chapters.

People often say that if you want to get along well with others, you should avoid discussing religion and politics. They say that when you're meeting your new boss, or your new neighbours, or your future in-laws, it's better not to start declaring dl your opinions about religious and political matters. You're bound to differ  them on some questions, and those disagreements could lead to a lot of ill feeling.
That is probably good advice. Many people take political and religious questions very seriously. Even when people don't have any personal stake in an issue, they can still have passionate opin- ions about it. By contrast, people are much less impassioned about factual matters that don't have any obvious political or religious implications. For example, it took more than 30 years for Richard Dawkins's semind science book, 7ñe Selfish Gene, to sell a mil- lion copies, whereas it took only rwo years for the same author's anti-religious book, 7ñe God Delusion, to reach the million mark. Likewise, the American linguistic scholar Noam Chomsky is far

more famous for his criticisms of US foreign policy than for his
groundbreaking scientific work on language acquisition.
Why do so many of us care so much about political and reli- gious matters? The most likely answer is that politicd and reli- gious attitudes reflect our basic values—our ideas about how to live and how to relate to other people and to the world. Because these values are so central to our sense of who we are, it's satisfying when people agree with our attitudes, and it's disconcerting when they don't.I When people choose partners of any kind, they gravi- tate toward those who share their politicd and religious attitudes. For example, as we mentioned at the beginning of the previous chapter, spouses tend to be very similar, on average, in their polit- ical and religious views.
In the previous chapter, we explained how the major factors of personality—particularly H and O underlie the two main trade-oPs in people's value systems. In this chapter, we discuss the role of personality in shaping our political attitudes.

Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO)
Researchers who study political attitudes have found that people's attitudes can be predicted very well by just two variables. Those variables are called Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). Both are assessed by self- report scales. To give you an idea of what these scales measure, we've listed some of the items on each 5cale in Table 7-1.
First	let's	consider	RWA,	which	was	developed	by	Bob
Altemeyer.2 People who have high levels of RWA show three related

TABLE 7-1	Example Items from the Right-Wing Authoritarianism and Social Dominance Orientation Scales

Everyone should have their own lifestyle, religious beliefs, and sexual preferences, even if it makes them different from everyone else. (R)
The only way our country can get through the crisis ahead is to get back to our traditional values, put some tough leaders in power, and silence the troublemakers spreading bad ideas.
The facts on crime, sexual immorality, and the recent public disorders all show that we have to crack down harder on deviant groups and troublemakers if we are going to save our moral standards and preserve law and order.
The established authorities generally turn out to be right about things, while the radicals and protestors are usually just “loudmouths” showing ofi their ignorance.
Our country needs free thinkers who have the courage to defy traditional ways, even if this upsets many people. (R)

Some groups of people are simply inferior to others.
To get ahead in life, it is sometimes necessary to step on other groups. Sometimes other groups must be kept in their place.
We should do what we can to equalize conditions for different groups. (R)
All groups should be given an equal chance in life. (R)

Note: “R” indicates a reverse-keyed statement, meaning that disagreement contributes to higher scores on the scale. RWA items from Altemeyer (1981, 1996); SDO items from Pratto et al. (1994).

tendencies: they conform to conventional norms, they obey the established authorities, and they support aggre5sion by those authorities against people who don't conform or who don't obey. In short, high RWA people tend to disapprove of people and ideas that ch&lenge the accepted beliefs and structure of society. In the 16th century they would have disliked the heliocentric theory of Copernicus. In the 19th century they would have disliked Darwin's

Theoiy of Evolution (come to think of it, many of them still do). High-RWA people in North America today have a predictable pat- tern of views on political issues: many of them oppose the legaliza- tion of (among other things) abortion and doctor-assisted suicide as well as same-sex marriage and recreational drugs.
Next let's consider SDO, which was developed by Felicia Pratto and /im Sidanius." People who are high in SDO gener- ally want some groups of people (presumably their own) to have higher status and greater wealth and power than other groups. In other words, they prefer hierarchy to equality, both within and between societies. In the l9th century they would have opposed the abolition of serfdom or slavery (unless, of course, they them- selves were serfs or slaves). In the early 20th century they would have opposed workplace safety laws. High-SDO people in North America today generally oppose state-run social welfare systems as well as public funding for health care and for higher education, and they generally oppose assistance for foreign countries and for other ethnic groups.
RWA and SDO aren't strongly related to each other, but both are strongly related to political orientation. When people are asked to place themselves on a scale from “left wing” to “right wing,” or from “liberal” to “conservative,” le9-wing or liberal people are likely to score low in both RWA and SDO, and the right-wing or conservative people are likely to score high in both.4 It's not sur- prising that the RWA scde predicts how right-wing someone is, but the SDO scale predicts this almost as strongly. For example, one large-scale study of US citizens found that people's self- placement on a scre from “liberal” to “conservative” correlated

over .50 with RWA and about .40 with SDO. Again, what makes this finding especidly interesting is that RWA and SDO are not so strongly related to each other—in this particular study, the cor- relation was a little more than .30.'
We resize that the above results place politically conservative
persons in a somewhat unfavourable light. But we should note that some people who hold conservative views are not particularly high in RWA or in SDO. Moreover, some of the correlates of politicd conservatism are more desirable: conservative5 tend to be slightly happier than liberals and to be slightly more satisfied with lifei they also tend to have a somewhat greater sense of personal control and personal responsibility.‘
Besides being related to people's general political orientations, RWA and SDO predict a variety of more specific attitudes.7 For example, both are associated with blind patriotism (“My country right or wrong!”) and with support for the war. (Which war? The current one.) Note, however, that RWA and SDO are associated with different reasons for supporting wars: high-RWA persons see the world as a dangerous place in which enemies threaten the val- ues and safety of one's people, whereas high-SDO persons see the world as a competitive place in which enemies must be defeated for the sake of the status, power, and wealth of one's people.
In addition, RWA and SDO  are both associated with dislike
of minority ethnic groups, of gays and lesbians, and of women's rights. The combination of RWA and SDO can predict those attitudes very well—considerably better than either variable on its own.8 Altemeyer has put it this way: if there were a Prejudice Olympics, the gold med¥ would go to people who are high in

both RWA and SDO (the “double highs,” as he calls them), and people high in SDO only or high in RWA only would win the silver and bronze, respectively. People low in both would finish out of the medal5, but we think they'd be happy just to have met so many wonderful people from dl over the world.

0	and Right-Wing Authoritarianism
How do RWA and SDO relate to the major dimensions of person- ality? First, as you'd probably expect, RWA is related to low levels of the O factor. This means that people who are more socially conservative—who favour the conventional social structure and conventional norms—tend to be lower in O. As we explained in Chapter 3, high-O people don't mind things that are new and unusu¥, so they're more likely to try eating strange foods or vis- iting faraway countries or using new technologies. And high-O people especially like new and unusual ideas—perhaps too much, in some cases—so they aren't strongly tied to conventional notions of how society should be structured.
The link between the O factor and low RWA is moderately strong, but it's far from perfect. You can probably think of some low-O people who don't have socidly conservative views and some high-O people who do. (You could probably find some of the lat- ter in the Vatican and some of the former in Las Vegas.) And even though people with higher levels of O have apredirporitioii to favour social change, there are many other variables that can influ- ence one's political perspective. For example, a high-O person who visits some extremely chaotic country might conclude that traditional values are needed to maintain a functioning society

even though his or her personal taste is for greater individual free- dom. Nevertheless, the point is that lower levels of O usually go along with higher levels of social conservatism.
One interesting twist on this trend is that the link between O and political attitudes gets stronger as people get older. Among people in their late teens and twenties, lower O is only weaHy related to socid conservatism. Among midAe-aged people, this link is much stronger. It's as if one's level of O exerts a stronger influence on one's politicd thinking as one gets older: low-O people gravitate toward socially conservative positions, and high- O people drift away from those positions.
In one of our research projects,' we studied personality and political attitudes in three countries: Canada, South Korea, and the United States. Our hypothesis was that in dl three countries, RWA should be more strongly related to O	than to any of the other personality factors. The results supported this hypothesis, but the links between RWA and O	weren't the same across the three countries. In our Korean and Canadian samples, the cor- relation between O and RWA was modest (about —.20); in the US sample, the correlation was much stronger (about —.50). This was a pretty big difference, and it's all the more striking given that it can't be explained by cultural differences—the USA	is culturally much more similar to Canada than to Korea.
But there was an important di4erence between our US par- ticipants and our participants from Canada and Korea: the US participants were much older. All of them were middle-aged adults, most of them university graduates, and their average age was over 50. By contrast, our Canadian and Korean participants were university students whose average age was around 20. So, the

di4erence between the US results and the Korean and Canadian results suggests that as people get older, their levels of O have stronger e4ects on their social conservatism.
Why would the link between low O and RWA become stronger after young adulthood? We can get some hints from research in behaviour genetics, which examines how the differ- ences between people can be explained by their different genes and their different environments (see Box 3—3). According to this research, differences among adolescents or young adults in polit- icd and religious views are due in large part to differences among the households in which they were raised.10 In other words, par- ents' attitudes have a big influence on the level of social conserva- tism of their adolescent and young adult children.
After young adulthood, however, the influence of parents' attitudes becomes weaker and genetic influences become stronger. Apparently, what happens is that from young adulthood on, people's religious and politicd views become les5 strongly influ- enced by those of the parents who raised them. Instead, adults gradually develop attitudes that are more consistent with their persondity characteristics—characteristics that have a genetic basis. In the case of socially conservative views, this largely means that the O factor exerts a stronger effect a9er young adulthood. Consider an 18-year-old who shares the socidly conservative views of his or her parents. If that 18-year-old is high in O, he or she is likely to become lower in RWA during later adulthood; if low in O, he or she will probably maintain the parents' conserva- tive views.
The link between RWA and low O explains some interesting facts that you've probably already noticed in everyday life. One

such fact is that academics and artists tend to be le9-wing in their politicd orientation. Consider academics—specificdly, university profes5ors. One large survey found that 44% of US university pro- fessors described themselves as liberal and only 9% as conservative (the other 47% were “moderate”). In contrast, a large survey of the general US public found that only 220/owere liberals, whereas 35% were conservatives (with the other 43% moderates).''
How does the O factor explain the lefi-wing political views of professors? People high in O tend to be intellectually curious, and such curiosity is perhaps the defining trait of the typical professor. At the same time, as we saw above, high O underlies socially lib- eral attitudes, including rejection of tradition& religiosity. Thus, it's not surprising that professors would be politically liberal.
One  way to view the role of O  is by examining di4erences
between academic disciplines regarding how left-wing their pro- fessors are. Fir5t of all, the most left-wing disciplines are generally those within the humanities and socid sciences, such as sociology, English literature, and philosophy.'2 People who are interested in these areas of knowledge tend to be very high in O.1" Also, within any given area of knowledge, the more leñ-wing professors are usually found in the more theoreticd or pure disciplines, and the more right-wing professors in the more practical or applied disciplines. For example, professors in economics are more liberd than those in banking and finance, professors in physics are more liberal than those in engineering, and professors in biology are more liberal than those in medicine. In these cases, it's likely that high levels of O have attracted some persons to the theoretic¥ disciplines and that those same high levels of O also favour a le9- wing political orientation.

Like professor5, artists tend to be very lefi-wing in their pol- itical orientation. (And among professors, those who teach in the fine or performing arts are among the most le9-wing, rivalling even the sociologists.)'4 As with professors, the lek-wing tendencies of artists can be understood in terms of the O factor. Artists tend to be very high in the traits that define O—such as aesthetic apprecia- tion, creativity, curiosity, and unconventiondity—and these same traits are together related to socially liber& attitudes and to the rejection of traditiond religiosity. Of course, some low-O people have some t&ent for painting or sculpting or for playing a musical instrument. But being an artist—creating a work of art for the sake of evoking emotions and ideas—is inherently a high-O endeavour. For this reason, highly original works of art rarely emphasize con- servative values. And most famou5 artists—from Pablo Picasso to Charlie Chaplin—have been le9-wing in their political views.
The O factor dso explains some other characteristics of leñ- wing and right-wing people. For example, one group of research- ers wondered whether people's politic& views could be inferred from the kinds of possessions they kept in their living spaces.” The researchers went to a university dormitory and, with the stu- dents' permission, carefully inspected the students' rooms, count- ing various kinds of objects. When the researchers examined the rooms, they didn't yet know the politics views of the students. But they asked those students in a separate 5urvey to place them- selves on a scde running from liber& to conservative. (This study was done in the United States, so “liber¥” and “conservative” mean le9-wing and right-wing.)
The re5earchers found that the more liberal students' rooms
had more books and music CDs—as well as a wider variety of

books and music CDs—than did the more conservative students' rooms. The liberd students also had more movie tickets and travel tickets. Notice that the everyday possessions in liberal students' rooms suggest wide intellectual and artistic interests—expressions of high O. By contrast, the more conservative students' rooms had more flags (especially US flags) and more sports-related decor than did the more liberal students' rooms, which suggested a

more conventional orientation. The conservative students dso had more event calendars, postage stamps, string and thread, and ironing boards and irons—possessions suggesting orderliness and planning ahead. This latter result is consistent with other findings of a modest link between the C factor and politics orientation, which we'll discuss later on.

H and Social Dominance Orientation
Now let's turn from RWA to SDO, the other major political atti- tude variable. As you'll recall, high-SDO people favour a hier- archical society in which some groups dominate other groups. The links between SDO and personality are also close to what you'd expect: SDO relates mainly to the low levels of the H fac- tor, meaning that high-H people generally oppose social hierarch- ies.l' The tendency for high-H people to be low in SDO makes sense in light of the traits that define the H factor, as discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. High-H people are straightforward and fair in their dealings with others, and they don't want superior status and wedth and power. Therefore, they dislike the idea of stepping on other groups or of keeping other groups in their place.
By the way, even though the H factor is a pretty good pre- dictor of egalitarian views, the link isn't perfect, or even close to perfect. Some people who are low in H might adopt egalitarian attitudes if it's in their interest to do so-in fact, being the high- profile leader of a left-wing political party might be an attractive prospect for a low-H person who holds no genuine commitment to the principle of social equality. And some people who are high in H (and low in SDO) might decide—rightly or wrongly—that

too much economic equality or too much multiculturalism causes problems.
High-SDO people share with low-H people a willingness to make decisions that by mo5t standards would be grossly unethicd. For example, one study showed that high-SDO students, just like low-H people, reported that they'd be willing to make money by exporting dangerous products to a developing countrj/*0 a find- ing similar to that observed for low-H people (as we'll discuss in Chapter 9). The same study dso examined what happened when decisions were made by pairs of people in which one member of each pair was arbitrarily designated as the leader. The results showed that the pairs most likely to make unethical decisions were those that combined a high SDO leader with a high RWA follower—a combination that Altemeyer has called the “lethal union.” A coun- try whose high-SDO leaders are supported by high-RWA citizens would be a prime candidate for starting aggressive wars—wars that the leaders would cynically justify as necessary for the security of the nation, simply as a way to r&ly the population.
We examined the link between H and SDO in the study we mentioned earlier, based on samples from Canada, Korea, and United States. In all three 5amples, low H was associated with high SDO. Now, you might recall that the link between low O and high RWA was stronger in the sample of middle-aged US adults than in the samples of Canadian and Korean university stu- dents. But in contrast, the correlation between low H and high SDO was similar across all three samples, averaging nearly —.40. It seem5 that people's personalities—specificdly, their levels of the H factor—influence their attitudes toward social inequdity to about the same extent regardless of their age. Again, this wasn't the

case for personality in relation to social conservatism: low levels of O were related to social conservatism only modestly in young adults, but more strongly in middle-aged adults.
Why the di4erence? Apparently, the influence of parents' atti- tudes on young people's attitudes is weaker for issues of social inequality than for issues of social change. Researchers typically find that similarity between parents and their (young adult) chil- dren is much stronger for RWA than for SDO.21 If you're a parent, you may have some important influence on your children's atti- tudes toward traditional or modern values, but you probably have much less influence on your children's attitudes about hierarchy or equality in society.

Personality and Political Party Support

We mentioned above that you can predict people's attitudes on many social and political issues by knowing their levels of RWA and SDO. People who are high iii both SDO and RWA are the most right-wing (or conservative), and people who are low in

both SDO and RWA are the most left-wing (or liberal). (People who are high in one and low in the other tend to be in the mid- dle overall, even though they have quite di4erent combinations of lefi-wing and right-wing views.) So, does this mean that the supporters of di4erent political parties are di4erent in personal- ity? Given that SDO is related to low H, and given that RWA is related to low O, you might expect supporters of le9-wing par- ties to be higher in both H and O than supporters of right-wing parties. Is this true?
The answer differs a bit from one country to the next. In a study of Italian voters, Antonio Chirumbolo and Luigi Leone found that those who voted for right-wing parties were, on aver- age, lower in H and lower in O than those who voted for lefi-wing parties—a result that follows the above logic exactly. Two other studies in Germany found very similar re5ults.23 As expected, these di4erences were only modest in size. But some data from US vot- ers—specifically, of middle-class, white, Anglo, mainly Christian residents of Oregon—gave somewhat different findings. The right-wing (Republican) voters did average lower in O than the leh-wing (Democratic) voters. Also, the Republican voters aver- aged somewhat higher in C than did the Democratic voters.24 However, the Republicans and Democrats averaged about the same in H.
The lack of any link between H and political party prefer- ence in the US study is somewhat puzzling. If low H relates to SDO, and if SDO in turn relates to right-wing (Republican) sup- port, then you'd expect Republicans, on average, to be somewhat low in H. So why don't we find this? Why were the Republicans no less and no more honest and humble than the Democrats?

Apparently, some mystery variable is b&ancing out what would otherwise be a tendency toward low H in Republicans, who tend to be high in SDO.
To understand what's happening, consider the following sports analogy. Suppose that you have a re&ly excellent vertical jump. Other things being equal, a better jumper should be a bet- ter volleybdl player, so we'd expect you to be an above-average volleyball player. But if in fact you're just an average volleyball player, then something else must be b¥ancing out the ePect of your jumping ability. For example, height also contributes to many aspects of volleyball performance, so if you're much shorter than average, then perhaps this could be cancelling out the e4ect of your excellent vertical jump.
What is it, then, that balances out the effect of SDO	so that Republicans aren't any lower in H? We suspect that it's religion. The more religious Americans tend to support the Republican Party, and on average, religious Americans are slightly above aver- age in the H factor. If SDO	and religiosity were both associated with being Republican, but if SDO	and religiosity had oppo/ire links with H,	then Republicans would be no higher or lower in H than Democrats would be. And this is essentially what we find. We've just revealed	that high-H people are slightly more likely than low-H people to be religious. If this makes you wonder exactly how personality is related to religious and spiritual beliefs,
stay tuned for our next chapter.

Some people don't believe in any beings or forces that are beyond the laws of nature. They reject the ideas of a God or gods, of souls or spirits, of miracles or magic powers. But other people are utterly certain of their beliefs in supernatural forces, and these beliefs may pervade almost every aspect of their lives.
The topic of this chapter is religiosity. We'll consider the role
of persondity in explaining which people will be religious and how they will express their religiosity. We'll also examine how religions encourage the expression of certain person&ity characteristics.
But we should begin by explaining why religiosity is not itself a persondity characteristic. First of all, a person's religiosity depends ultimately on his or her beliefs about the supernatural or spiritual world; by contrast, a person's level of a persondity dispos- ition doesn't depend on any particular set of beliefs. Also, religios- ity often involves following a way of life that is meant to achieve harmony with some higher power—typically God, or the universe itself. A religious way of life involves a wide range of behaviours that wouldn't otherwise go together—for example, a given religion

118	Kibeom Lee and Michael C. Ashton

may prescribe various rules about what to eat or when to work or whom to marry.' By contrast, the behaviours associated with a given personality disposition usually share some obvious similar- ities; for example, the X factor of personality involves behaviours such as leading, entertaining, and socializing with others.

Personality and Religious Beliefs
So, who believes in the supernaturd, and who doesn't? In modern countries, persondity characteristics give us only vague hints as to which people will be believers. There is a weak tendency for people who are nicer or more soft-hearted to be more likely to believe in some supernatural forces. In a study we conducted with our graduate student Babatunde Ogunfowora, we found that belief in the supernaturd was modestly associated with higher levels of the H, A, and E factors.2 One potentid reason for these associations is that nicer, more sofi-hearted people like to believe there is some- thing more to life than mere physical existence. For example, they like the idea that people have souls that will survive their bodies, and they like the idea that people who are separated by death will meet in an a9erlife. By contrast, people who are lower in H, A, and E—people who are not quite so nice, or a bit less so9- hearted—may lack this motivation to believe in an afterlife and may even take some satisfaction from rejecting those comforting beliefs. Still, the relations between personality and supernatural beliefs are rather weak. (In case you'd like some numbers, the cor- relations of H and A and E with belief in the supernatur¥ are only in the .20s.) This means that many people don't fit the trend: you can find a lot of very nice, so9-hearted people who reject any

belief in the supernatural, and a lot of not-so-nice, hard-hearted people who accept such beliefs quite decidedly.
The link between so9-heartedness and supernatural beliefs comes from our own data, but other researchers have found similar results. In a review of over 60 previous studies, Vassilis Saroglou found that, on average, religious people are slightly more so9-hearted than non-religious people.3
Now, given that personality and religiosity are related, you might wonder which one influences the other. Do persondity traits influence religiosity, or do religious beliefs influence person- ality? So far, the evidence is very limited, but it IRO5tly favours the former direction of influence. When researchers have followed people over many years, they've found that personality traits early in life predict religiosity later in life, more than the other way around.4
One other hint that personality influences religious beliefs comes from the pattern of sex differences in these variables. On average, women are somewhat more soft-hearted than men and slightly more likely to believe in the supernatural. If we control for the sex difference in so9-heartedness, the sex di4erence in super- natural beliefs is reduced by about half. But if we instead control for the sex di4erence in supernatural beliefs, the sex di4erence in so9-heartedness is diminished only slightly. This pattern of results suggests that women are somewhat more strongly attracted to supernaturd beliefs by virtue of being somewhat more so9- hearted than men.'
The idea that religious people tend to be sofi-hearted is partly
consistent—but only partly—with some claims from a 2006 book
by the socid scientist Arthur Brooks.‘ He noted the results of a

survey that indicated that religious Americans (i.e., those who go to their house of worship nearly every week) donated three- and-a-half times more money to charities than did non-religious Americans ($2,210 versus $642). He also stated that the greater generosity of religious Americans persists even when one considers only those donation5 that were made to non-religious charities. Technicdly, this statement is true, but the gap between religious and non-religious Americans in secular giving, as reported by Brooks, is quite sm¥l: religious Americans donated only about 10% more than did non-religious Americans to secular charities ($532 to $467). So, religious Americans give more—but only slightly more—money to secular charities than do non-religious Americans. This small di4erence is about what you'd expect given the modest link between religiosity and so9-heartedness.7
Relatively few people reject a// supernatural beliefs. Even in countries where most people don't belong to an organized reli- gion, most people still believe in some supernatural beings or forces. But if persondity is only modestly related to belief in the supernatural, what is it that determines which people will be hard-core 5keptics,	rejecting	all supernaturd	beliefs?	One candidate is exposure to science. The very mission of science is to explain our surroundings—including the origins of humans, of life, of the Earth, and of the universe—in terms of laws that solely involve natural cause5. So as you might expect, scientists are much more likely than other people to reject supernaturd beliefs. In one study, 41% of US		scientists indicated that they did not believe in God or any other higher power, as opposed to only 4% of the US general public.' A similar study found that the proportion of disbelievers was 45% for scientists in generd and a

remarkably high 72% for members of the Nations Academy of Sciences, whose members are highly accomplished scientists.' Of cour5e, this still leaves many scientists—even many distinguished scientists—who do believe in the supernaturd, including some who are devoutly religious. But the proportion of scientists who are skeptics is clearly very high.
The above findings leave open the question of whether it's
really the study of science that makes scientists reject belief in the supernatural. It might be instead that scientists are simply the kind of people who would have rejected supernatural beliefs even without any study of science. But the personality charac- teristics of scientists can't explain their lack of religiosity. As we noted above, personality characteristics are at most only a small part of the story, and in any case scientists aren't so much di4erent in personality from people in general. (The data from Goldberg's sample of Oregon community residents indicate that people with greater interest in scientific careers tend to be somewhat high in the O factor, and slightly low in the “soñ-heartedness” factors of H, A, and E. But the di4erences are small.)
But if the skepticism shown by scientists isn't due to their per- sondities, you might wonder whether it's their intelligence that's responsible: after all, scientists tend to be smart people. But there's only a modest link between having a high IQ and rejecting the supernatural. One recent large-scale study of US teenagers found that the average IQ among atheists was about 5 points higher than that of the population in generd. This means that dthough athe- ists are somewhat smarter on average than non-atheists, the differ- ence is not large; for example, more than one-third of non-atheists would have a higher IQ  than the average atheist. (In the same

study, by the way, agnostics averaged about 3 IQ points higher than the general population. Jews and Anglicans or Episcopalians had average IQs 1 or 2 points higher than those of the atheists, and the average IQ among Catholics was about equal to that of the general population. The more “liberal” Protestant denominations were slightly above average, and the more “dogmatic” Protestant denominations somewhat below average.)10
Taken together, all of the above findings suggest that scien- tists' individud characteristics their levels of IQ and the major personality factors—aren't the main reasons for their lack of super- natural beliefs. Instead, their skepticism about the supernaturd is probably due mostly to their intensive study of science and their commitment to the scientific method.

Traditional Religion versus Mystical Spirituality: The Role of O
Now let's move on to our second question about religion and per- sonality. Among people who do believe in the supernatural, how does person¥ity relate to the style or form of their beliefs—to the way they express their religiosity or spirituality? Here it's the O factor that plays the most important role.
The O factor doesn't tell us much about whether or not a per- son will believe in the supernatural. People who deny the existence of any and all supernaturd forces or beings people who don't believe in God or souls or spirits or magic or anything outside the natural world—are about equally likely to be high or low in
O. What the O factor can tell us, however, is zr£ar bind of super- natural beliefs people are likely to hold.

On the one hand, low-O people who believe in the super- natural tend to have traditional religious beliefs. Low-O persons prefer strict adherence to the beliefs and practices of the main- stream religious community. For example, in societies having a Christian religious tradition, low-O persons (or at least those low-O persons raised in religious households) are inclined to accept the literd truth of the Bible—to believe in the creation story as given in Genesis, in the existence of God  and Satan and heaven and hell, and in the virgin birth and resurrection of Jesus Christ. As you might expect, these low-O believers are very socially conservative.
On the other hand, high-O people who believe in the super- natural tend to have what we call mystically spiritual beliefs. For example, in Western societies, high-O persons are inclined to adopt a variety of magicd, occult, or paranormd beliefs, includ- ing beliefs in astrology, witchcraft, ghosts, extrasensory percep- tion, and psychoŃnesis. They're also inclined to adopt teachings from Eastern religions such as Buddhism or Hinduism or from the spiritual traditions of Native American peoples. In gener¥, high-O persons are attracted to new religious movements that emphasize spiritual searching by the individual. These high-O believers, unlike the traditiondly religious low-O believers, are inclined to be slightly liberal on socid issues.
The O  factor thus has moderately strong—and opposite—
links with these two forms of supernaturd beliefs. In one large- scale study, Gerard Saucier and Katarzyna Skrzypińska found that O correlated about —.25 with traditional religiosity and about .40 with mystic¥ spirituality.11So even though O can't tell us whether a person will accept or reject the existence of supernatural beings

or forces, it can give us some clues as to which kinds of super- natural beliefs he or she would be more inclined to hold.'2
The links between O and religious or spiritu¥ beliefs give an interesting in5ight about the history of religious movements. People who start a new religion or who become its enthusiastic early converts are likely to be high in O. People who maintain an established religion or who become its most devout defenders are likely to be low in O.

Reasons for Religious Observance: The Role of H

We've explained how it's the O factor of personality that plays the biggest role in explaining the style or form of people's beliefs in the supernatural—whether people will be religious tradition¥ists or spiritual mystics. But the H factor also plays a part in the domain of religion. As we mentioned in the previous chapter, high-H people are 5lightly more likely than low-H people to be religious. And as we mentioned earlier in this chapter, a likely reason for this link (and for the similar links of the A and E factors with religiO5ity) is that so9-hearted, sympathetic people tend to favour the ideas that people have souls that will survive their bodies and that people who are separated by death will meet in an a9erlife.
But besides having a modest link with religious and spiritu& beliefs, the H factor is involved in the reasons people have for expressing those beliefs. Consider two people who both belong to the same church or other religious group. Both of them attend religious services regularly, both of them donate money to their religious group and its causes, and both of them observe the rit- uals of their religion. But the two have utterly different reasons for

their outward adherence to the rules of their religious community. For one of those people, these visible signs of religious commit- ment are genuine expressions of his or her deepest beliefs. For the other person, the same behaviours are merely for public consump- tion, intended simply to project an image of respectability and to make contacts with people of high status in that community. This person might believe in the tenets of his or her religion, but this belief isn't what motivates his or her public religiosity.
Now, most people who belong to a religious community won't be such clear-cut cases as our two examples above; instead, most will have some mixture of these two reasons for their pub- lic displays of religiosity. But some people are clearly more sin- cere than others in their religious observances. And as you would guess, it's high-H people whose expressions of religious devotion are more genuine, and low-H people whose expressions are more cynicd. That said, you can think of some circumstances in which it wouldn't work this way. Imagine a highly religious and highly conformist society that essentially ostracizes people who don't go through the motions of religious observance. In such a society, even high-H non-believers might reluctantly decide that they have no choice but to pretend to be religious.
The link between the H  factor and the motivation for reli- gious observance applies to religious leaders as well as to follow- ers. Most people who enter the clergy are genuinely religious, and people who indicate a strong interest in religious vocations are, on average, rather high in H." Nevertheless, there are rea- sons why at least some low-H people are attracted to the career of religious leader. A religious vocation could provide a path for achieving some position of high status. For example, within a

large denomination, one could hope to navigate one's way into the top positions of the hierarchy of religious authorities. And even within small, loc¥ religious communities, there is the prospect of wielding considerable influence over one's congregation. In the cases of very low-H people, there is also the potenti¥ for financial or sexual exploitation of one's followers. Such case5 are well known among established religions but are perhaps especially prevdent among new religious cults. And of course, low-H people with suf- ficient charisma and organizational skills can aspire to become the next great televangelist, soliciting donations from a vast popula- tion of unquestioning followers.

Do Religions Promote High H?

The H factor influences the expression of religiosity; conversely, religious teachings can be designed to influence the expression of the H factor. Most religions encourage the ideal of behaving as a high-H person—being honest and humble in dedings with others. Virtually every major religious tradition has its counter- part of the Golden Rule, often paraphrased from the King James Bible as “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” But the crucial difference among religions is in how widely this ideal is to be applied: Is everyone to be treated fairly, or only the other members of one's own group?
Some religious teachings encourage believers to act as high-H persons toward co-religionists but as low-H persons toward out- siders. Consider the Old Testament: in the Book of Deuteronomy, the Ten Commandments instruct believers not to commit murder or the9 or adultery or perjury. Later chapters of Deuteronomy,

however, instruct believers to commit genocide against various other religious groups. For example, “when the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations ... then you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy” (Deuteronomy 7:1—2,NIV). Likewise, “do not leave alive any- thing that breathes. Completely destroy them ... as the Lord your God has commanded you” (Deuteronomy 20:16, NIV).I4 (We should mention, by the way, that religions have no monopoly on genocide: most of the state-sponsored mass murders of the 20th century were inspired by non-religiou5 ideologies.)
In some religious traditions, by contrast, the imperative to treat others fairly is truly universal, with no distinction drawn between co-religionists and outsiders. Con5ider the Religious Society of Friends, better known as the Quakers. This sect separ- ated from the Church of England during the 17th century and subsequently spread to other areas of the world. Among the defin- ing features of the QuAer movement are its testimonies, which provide principles for how to live. For example, the Testimony of Simplicity urges believers to avoid ostentation and materidism, and hence encourages high-H behaviours. Note that these Quaker testimonies are meant to govern one's interactions with Quakers and non-Quakers alike. The Testimony of Integrity emphasizes telling the truth (and avoiding even indirect deceptions) as well as fair dealing: early Quakers gained reputations as honest business- men through their practices of paying decent wages to their (non- Quaker) workers and setting fixed prices when selling goods to their (also non-Quaker) customers. The Testimony of Peace encourages pacifism and hence forbids aggression against outgroups. Among

the early settlers of North America, the Quakers were known for their peaceful relations—and their scrupulous adherence to treat- ies—with Native Americans. The Testimony of Equality holds that all persons have equal rights and hence forbids exploitation of outgroups. As early as the l8th century, the Quakers declared their opposition to the slave trade and to slavery itself, and con- temporary Quakers continue to advocate for human rights.
Why do some religions encourage high-H behaviours only within the group, whereas others encourage high-H behaviours toward everyone? It may depend in part on whether the religion is suited for high-O people or low-O people. The more dogmatic or fundamentdist movements—low in O  require obedience and conformity; they draw strong distinctions between “us” and “them,” with especially strong moral obligations toward the for- mer but few if any toward the latter. By contrast, the more liberal or progressive movements—high in O—aren't much concerned with obedience and conformity; they draw weaker distinctions between us and them, with moral obligations extended toward dl.
As we've seen in this chapter, the H factor is implicated in several aspects of people's religious beliefs. In the next chapter, we'll consider three domains in which H is even more strongly involved: money, power, and sex.

The behaviour of low-H people is expressed in many aspects of life. Here we'll consider three domains in which people who are very low in H really distinguish themselves: money, power, and sex.

Money
Most people who are low in H will usually try to get money through perfectly legal means, by working and investing. This simply reflects the reality that crime usually doesn't pay. Most low-H people redize that it's hard to get away with the9 or fraud for a long time, and they decide that it's better to look for more reliable ways of getting rich. But in principle, they quite like the idea of getting something for nothing, and it doesn't bother them if that particular something comes at someone else's expense. So the people who are most ready to steal and to swindle when the opportunity arises—and the people who do in fact commit most of the acquisitive crimes—are people low in H.

In some of our own research studies, we've asked students to report—confidentially and anonymously—the dollar v&ue of the money and merchandise they've stolen. What we always find is that the people who have stolen the most—whether by shopli9- ing, by break and enter, by pilfering on the job, or otherwise—are much below average in H. Generally, most of the total amount stolen is accounted for by less than 10% of the students, and on average those students are lower in H than about 80% to 90% of students overall.1
Now, you might think it's not really so impressive that the people who say they're low in H are the same people who say they've stolen a lot. Couldn't it all just be a matter of who is willing to admit, or even exaggerate, their own dishonesty? But actu¥ly, it isn't. Even when we measure the students' persondities u5ing observer reports—provided by the student's roommate, or best friend, or boyfriend/girlfriend—low levels of H are still related to self-reports of the9. And those self-reports of the9 are related to all the various aspects of low H, including the aspects that don't have any obvious, transparent link with theft: the college students who've stolen the most are mainly the same ones who think they're better than others and who like to manipulate people. (For some research that isn't based on participants' admissions of past wrong- doings, see Box 9—1 for a study that relied on direct observations of dishonest behaviour.)
Low H has a fairly strong link with the9 (and with crime and delinquency more generally), but that link is far from perfect, for several reasons. On the one hand, some people who are low in H have few opportunities to steal, and some feel rich enough that they have little motivation to do so. And many low-H people have

other persondity traits that make them cautious about stealing. As we mentioned in Chapter 4, low-H persons who are also low in C and low in E are strong candidates for criminal activity, whereas low-H persons who are high in C and high in E express their dis- honesty a lot more prudently.
At the same time, some high-H people occasionally commit dishonest acts. Sometimes a situation is tempting enough that only people very high in H resist the urge to act selfishly. And in some situations, dishonest actions are motivated less by low H than by other characteristics. A young person who wouldn't think of stealing (or cheating, etc.) on his or her own might succumb to peer pressure. Or a young person who has no intrinsic motivation to commit such a crime might do so purely as an act of rebel- lion against parents or authority figures. Because of these varying circumstances, we can't always be sure that a particular dishonest act was driven by a low level of H in the person who committed that act. To take just one example, many high-H people would steal out of desperation if they or their kin were hungry or cold or sick. This situation confronts very few, if any, of the students in our samples, but it's worth remembering that dthough a given behaviour can be strongly influenced by a personality trait in one situation, the same behaviour may be dmost irrelevant to that persondity trait in another situation.
Some ways of studying persondity and behaviour allow us to control for situationd influences and thereby see the full strength of the link between low H and various dishonest actions. Probably the best such approach is to ask people to respond to hypothetic¥ scenarios that depict some opportunity to act dishonestly for per- sond gain. By describing the features of these scenarios in just the right way, we can find out how people would act in a prototypical

default situation  in the absence of any risk of getting caught, of any truly desperate straits, or of any pressures to conform or to rebel. This approach also allows us to find out how personality would relate to dishonest behaviours of a kind that few people have the opportunity to commit.
One such kind of dishone5ty is corporate crime, whereby officids commit crimes that profit their company. This form of dishonest behaviour is interesting for the ways in which it differs from more common crimes. Unlike common thefi or robbery, corporate crime is usually committed by people who have high levels of income, education, and occupational 5tatus. And unlike common their or robbery, it ofien involves massive amounts of money taken from many people.
Few people ever find themselves in a position to commit large-scale corporate crimes. But how many people would do so, given the chance? And how much is personality—particularly a low-H persondity—implicated in the willingness to commit those crimes? We've studied this by asking several hundred uni- versity students to respond to a series of scenarios in which they take the role of a corporate executive. Each scenario describes an opportunity to maximize the company's profit—and the respond- ent's income—in a highly unethicd way that involves corrupt business practices, risks to public health and safety, or damage to the environment. Here's just one example:

Suppose that you are in charge of sales for a large corpora- tion that exports telecommunications equipment to countries around the world. Recently, you have been trying to obtain the contract for supplying a new telecom system to Impoveria, a developing nation that has only recently begun to modernize.

In negotiations with the president of Impoveria and his cabinet, you have learned that your company's bid is not the lowest; instead, two of your competitor companies have lower bids. However, the president and his cabinet members have told you that you can still have the contract, if you agree to send back 5% of the money received from the Impoverian gov- ernment to their own personal bank accounts in Switzerland. It is clear to you that, even with this 5% kickback, your company will still make a substantial profit on this contract, and that you will be seen as the person who made it happen.
Would you recommend that your company agree to the
conditions and sign the contract?
(1) Definitely Not   (2) Probably Not
(3) Probably Yes	(4) Definitely Yes

So, how many of our students would put profit Aead of mor- ality? About 15% responded “probably yes” or “definitely yes” to most of the scenarios. Conversely, about I 5% responded “defin- itely not” to most scenarios. (The other 70% mainly responded “probably not”; this means that they leaned toward the ethical option, but not as strongly as you might want our future corpor- ate leaders to do.)
And what about the personalities of the students? We meas- ured their levels of the HEXACO factors by self-report and dso by observer report from their friends or roommates or romantic partners. Of the students who were most willing to profit at the expense of the public good, about three-quarters were below aver- age in H; by contrast, of the students who were least willing, about three-quarters were above average in H.3

Perhaps thèse results overestimate the number of students who would make the unethical business decisions. AfÏer all, the situations were hypothetical, without any real risks of public harm or of crimin¥ prosecution. But then again, the situations also lacked real money, so perhaps in a real-life situation even more of the students would put money over morality.
Unethical corporate activity is one way that low-H people express their personalities in today's market economy. But to some extent, the market economy actually constrains the selfishness of low-H people, because most of them can satïsÇ their greed only by producing things that others want. When law enforce- ment is good enough that crime generally doesn't pay, and when people can freely exchange labour and property, the only reliable way to get rich is to provide a good or a service that others will buy. As Adam Smith put it, “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest.”4 The beauty of Smith's free market, at least in principle, is that the would-be thÎef and the would-be overlord must work for a living, perhaps in the food processing industry.
Yet low-H people find ways to defeat the spirit, and even the letter, of the rules that govern a market economy. The essence of the low-H persondity is a willingness to gain by exploitïng others, and therefore such people will always be ready to cheat in their economic transactions, with greater or lesser degrees of subtlety.
Anyone who sells on the principle “Let the buyer beware” is following the low-H strategy ofdoing business. Think ofthe stereo- type of the used-car salesman or the shady building contractor. Similarly, anyone who tricks people into maÙng ill-advised deals

is using a classic low-H tactic. One excellent example is predatory lending, where the lender's aim is to foreclose on the assets of a borrower who probably will be unable to repay a loan. (So too is borrowing under fdse pretences, for example, by exaggerating income on a loan application or by planning simply to walk away if unable to repay the loan.) Yet another tactic of low-H persons involves shi9ing costs onto third parties so that the public must pay the “externdities” associated with their business. Classic cases here are the business owner who dumps toxic waste or who sells addictive drugs or deadly weapons.
Tax evasion is another means by which low-H people under- mine the market economy. Tax rates differ from one jurisdiction to the next, but every society must raise some taxes to pay for the public goods that its people deem important. Low-H people are disproportionately those who evade their taxes or avoid them in ways that are legal but contrary to the spirit of the laws. For example, income tax laws in many countries gener&ly dlow a var- iety of exemptions and deductions. Some of these are obvious and are claimed by virtually everyone, but others are obscure loop- holes that are discovered only by people who actively search for them. This means that the burden of paying taxes is shiñed from people who try to avoid paying them onto people who don't. This essentially means that high-H persons—those whose sense of social responsibility outweighs their greed—end up subsidiz- ing low-H persons. (There are some high-H people who openly refuse to pay taxe5 on the grounds that the money would be used for immoral purposes, such as subsidizing aggressive wars. But we doubt that many of the tax-dodging crowd are taking their inspir- ation from Thoreau or Gandhi.) And the free riding of low-H

persons isn't limited to tax evasion: it is people who are low in H who would claim benefits they don't really deserve, as in cases of welfare fraud or disability insurance fraud.

Even when low-H people conform perfectly to the ideals of the market economy, they can still do a lot of harm. Consider conspicuous consumption, which is one of the hallmarks of the low-H personality. At first regard, this might not seem to be a major socid problem: If low-H people want to waste their money on expensive, flashy toys, well, who cares? But conspicuous con- sumption by some has harmful consequences for all.
The economist Robert H. Frank has explained the problem
as follows.‘ First, people try to outspend others on certain kinds of goods, simply so that they can have better—and be seen to have better—than other people do. For example, people like to have the nicest car or house or clothes or jewellery or furniture or restaurant reservations. In contrast, they don't compete in this way when spending money on, say, their insurance policies. This produces an expenditure arms race, in which people spend more and more money on these so-cdled positiond goods. To get that money, people may take on large debts and may sacrifice much of their leisure time; they may also demand reductions in taxes— taxes that could be spent on public goods such as roads or schools or hospitals. But this escalation of spending doesn't make people any happier, because each person's relative standing in the compe- tition of consumption remains more or less the same: on average, we never actudly overtake the Joneses.

Now, if high-H people could just exempt themselves from this competition dtogether, they could avoid many of its negative effects. But they can't. When low-H people create a speculative bubble (such as the red estate bubbles of the 2000s), the result is an economic crisis that causes unemployment for low-H and high-H people dike. And the arms race for luxury goods will cause most high-H people to spend more money even though they don't care about showing off. For example, when low-H people buy ever larger cars in an effort to show off, high-H people who would prefer to buy smaller cars feel at higher risk of being killed in a car accident and may feel compelled to upsize. Or when low-H people spend extravagantly on, say, business suits, high-H people who would rather just buy a basic suit may find themselves being taken less seriously at job interviews, making them feel compelled to follow the mantra of “dress for success.”

Power
When Lord Acton said that power corrupts, he missed hdf the story: power dso aitrarr/ the corrupt. Low-H people crave power, and they express this in a variety of attitudes. Consider the simple statement, “I would like to have more power than other people,” which  Goldberg included in a questionnaire that he gave to his sample of Oregon adults. Among people who strongly disagreed with that statement, the large majority (over 80%) were above aver- age in the H factor; among people who agreed or strongly agreed, most (again over 80%) were below average in the H factor.
Other links between low H and the need for power over others emerged from this sample of Oregon adults. Goldberg

administered the Campbell Interest and Skill Survey, which assesses people's interests in various occupations and indicates how closely their responses match those of workers in those occupa- tions. For example, if the pattern of your responses on the survey is similar to that of accountants, then you will score highly on the “Accountants” scale. There are 59 such occupations in this sur- vey, and of those 59, the “CEO/President” scde was the one that showed the strongest link with low levels of the H factor (a correla- tion of about —.35). This meant that even though many CEOs and presidents are highly ethical people, the average CEO or president apparently has interests similar to those of low-H people.
Probably the central problem of human society is that the
people who most want power—people low in H—are also the people most likely to abuse it. Democracy and limited govern- ment can go a long way toward solving this problem. In a democ- racy, you can gain power only by making some credible promises to give voters things they want, and you can keep power only by persuading voters that you have delivered on those promises. And in any system of limited government, you can have only so much power, because other branches and levels of government will act as checks against you.
But even in countries that enjoy democratic and limited gov- ernment, low-H people can gain power by deceit and then abuse that power. When seeking power, skilled politicians will successfully mislead voters, and deception in politics is les5 strictly regulated than is deception in the marketplace. For example, advertising by political candidates generally isn't subject to the laws that govern commercial advertising, and promises by politicd candidates gener- ally aren't treated as formd contracts. In fact, a tot& avoidance of

deception can be fatal to success in politics: a politician who tells people what they don't want to hear will probably not last long.
Once ensconced in office, politicians—and the public ser- vants who carry out their policies—can u5e their power to per- sond advantage, as far as they can get away with doing so. Even the least corrupt countries have occasional scandals when polit- icians and other government officids are caught taking bribes or kickbacks or awarding contracts to their cronies. Another variant is the misuse of public funds, as when politicians or bureaucrats claim extravagant amounts for expenses that are personal rather than professional. (Of course, this also happens in the private sec- tor, and sometimes too in not-for-profit organizations.)
But the abuse of power by political leaders and government ofFicids is hardly limited to persond corruption. The most spec- tacular—and terrifying—abuses are those involving aggressive war and other forms of mass murder. When low-H persons attain positions of essentially unchecked power, and when those persons are motivated by some ideology, the consequences are oñen hor- rific. In the most extreme cases—think of Hitler or Stalin  the toll may be counted in the tens of millions of innocent lives.
Let's turn now to power on a much pettier scale. In mod- ern societies, economic power is di4used throughout the private sector rather than concentrated solely in government. In cor- porations spanning the range of economic activity, many low-H workers jockey for position, hoping to ascend the corporate ladder by whatever means will succeed. Just as a politician will tell voters what they want to hear, many employees will be yes-men and yes- women, cynically currying favour with their supervisors and other bosses in the hope of rising through the corporate ranks. But the

tactics used by low-H employees to get ahead at work are not lim- ited to yea-saying and flattery (recdl our discussion of workplace impression management in Chapter 5). They also practise a much wider array of Machiavellian tactics. Some of them claim credit for achievements that were really due—at least in large part—to the effort and talent of others. And some go even further, seek- ing to damage the reputations of co-workers by criticizing their work unjustly or by spreading unflattering rumours about them, whether true or not. And a few will go so far as to threaten and intimidate their current or prospective rivals.
All of these examples of Machiavellian tactics in the workplace have their counterparts in schools, from the primary grades right up to university classes. In some cases the goal is to gain favour with teachers, but the main preoccupation for most students is their status with their peers. And here the young low-H person may find much opportunity for bullying others,7 whether by overt physicd intimidation (of the kind typically favoured by boys) or by more subtle arts of social exclusion (which are perhaps practised more skilfully by girls than by boys, who nonetheless get a lot of practice). For very low-H people, socid relationships are a zero sum game in which dl tactics are justified in the battle to attain status.

Sex
Sex is a domain in which people give each other much pleasure, but it's dso one in which people exploit each other quite ruth- lessly. Modern countries generally have laws that limit the worst of the sexud exploitation that some low-H people would be tempted to commit, such as sexual assaults or sexual abuse of children. But

low H is dso involved in other, subcriminal forms of exploitation
in sexual relationships.
Consider the cad philosophy of “love them and leave them” (or its less euphemistic equivdent involving words that start with “f”). In this familiar story, one person, almost always a man, uses false aPection or fdse promises to obtain sexual favours from another person, ¥most dways a woman. He pretends to love her simply so that she will let him have sex with her. This is classic low-H behaviour, and at lea5t under some conditions, it would serve to propagate low-H tendencies into the next generation: the successful Don Juan might end up as the biologicd father of many children by many mothers, without actually raising those children or providing for them in any way.
A  di4erent kind of exploitation  by low-H men is that of
polygyny, whereby 5ome men have more than one wife and other men remain unmarried. Note that even though the status of women in polygynous societies is generdly rather low, not all women are opposed to polygyny. To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw, a woman might prefer a one-tenth share of a first-rate man to a full share of a third-rate man, if we assume that the men who acquire multiple wives are “first-rate” by definition. However, polygyny is grossly exploitive of the men in polygynous societies who-for whatever reason—are unable to marry. In a polygyn- ous society, many men have little prospect of having a wife and children and thus of having any family life. This isn't to say that the men who do attain multiple wives must be low in H, but it's a fair bet that low-H men are those who are most supportive of such a system. (Recall from Chapter 7 that people who favour social hierarchies tend to be low in H.)

Another form of exploitation ïs that of cheating on a roman- tic partner with whom one is supposed to have a monogamous relationship. People low in H  men or women—will not be much deterred from infidelity by an ethical reluctance to betray the trust of their spouse. If the opportunity cornes along to have an a4air with someone sexier—either more physic&ly attractive or of higher status—the low-H person will likely take it. This isn't to say that the correspondence between low H and infidelity is perfect: some low-H people will simply not be much interested in extramaritd a4airs, or will be too wary of the reaction of a vigilant and suspicious spousei and a few high-H people will have affairs if their spouse is suŒciently unkind or if their marriage is suŒ- ciently unhappy. But for very low-H people, the default setting is a willingness to cheat on their spouse.
Sexud histories tend to differ between low-H people and
high-H people, especially among men. Low-H people pursue more short-term relationships, make more attempts to poach other people's partners, and have more sex partners than do high- H people. In one of our studies, we asked univer5ity students to indicate how many di4erent sex partners they realisticAly fore- saw themselves having during the next five years. About 10% of male students indicated nine or more partners, and about three- quarters of those students scored below the average of the H fac- tor.' None of the other personality factors was a better predictor than H of the expected number of sex partners. This doesn't mean that the low-H men would necessarily end up with more sex part- ners, although we expect that to some extent they would. But the fact that they expect—and presumably want to have—more partners is itself interesting.

As we mentioned above, it's mostly men—low-H men—who adopt the classic cad pattern of using insincere aRection as a means to gaining sexual gratification. Perhaps the fern&e equivalent of the cad is the tease: a woman who holA out the fdse prospect of a sexual relationship with a man in order to obtain from him favours of variow kinds—gi9s of money or jewellery, help with work at school or the ofFice, and so on. For women low in H, sex and aRec- tion are tools for manipulating men into giving them what they want. Another incarnation of the low-H woman is the gold digger, who seeks to marry simply with a view to obtaining the wealth and status of her prospective husband, either with or without the plan to divorce him later. For women low in H (and especially Aose who are dso low in E), the idea of marrying for love seems ridiculously naive, and the idea of marrying for money is simply common sense.
Low H also plays an important role in sexual harassment of the quid pro quo variety. In the typical sexual quid pro quo, a person in a position of authority, usually a man, obtains sex- ual favours from a person having less power, usually a woman, in exchange for some reward, such as a raise or a promotion. Sometimes the “reward” is simply the avoidance of some penalty, such as being fired.
In one of our research projects, we compared the persondities of people who would engage in quid pro quo sexu¥ harassment with those of people who wouldn't.' In studying this question, we wanted to examine both “sides” of the quid pro quo equation: What are the personality traits of people who would o4er rewards in exchange for sexual favours? And what are the personality traits of people who would grant—or even o4er—sexual favours in exchange for rewards?

To find out, we asked our research participants—men and women university students—to consider two pairs of related scen- arios. Here's one of the two pairs:

Suppose that you are a high-level government oocial. You are currently making decisions about the awarding of a major government contract, and there are several companies that are competing for this contract. Yoi1 are very strongly attracted to the representative of one of these companies, and this person seems to be very strongly motivated to get the contract (which would mean a large commission for that representative). In fact, you are sure that this person would perform sexual favours in exchange for a major government contract, and you are also sure that you would not be caught or punished in any way for mAing this arrangement.
Would you give this representative the contract in exchange for sexual favours?
(l) Definitely No	(2) Probably Not
(3) Probably Yes	(4) Definitely Yes

Now imagine a situation similar to the one above, but suppose instead that you are a company representative instead of a gov- ernment offici&. Assume that you could definitely receive the contract and commission in exchange for sexual favours, and that no one would find out about this exchange.
Would you be willing to provide sexu£ favours in exchange
for the contract?
(1) Definitely Not	(2) Probably Not
(3) Probably Yes	(4) Definitely Yes

As you can see, the first scenario assesses the willingness to trade rewards for sexual favours, and the second assesses the con- verse. Notice that there is no suggestion of any desperate circum- stances facing the company representative: what we wanted to measure was the willingness to trade sexud favours for some sub- stantial reward even when one's basic needs are securely being met. (We redized that a person who normally would never seek advan- tage through sexual favours might submit to a sexual quid pro quo if there seemed to be no other choice: consider, for example, a single mother faced with the prospect of losing her job.)
How many of our participant5 indicated a willingness to make
these sexud quid pro quos? Only a minority, but a fairly substantial minority. For each scenario in the pair given above, about three- quarter5 of women and about one-h&f of men responded “def- initely not”; fewer than 10% of women and about 20% of men responded “probably yes” or “definitely yes.” Men were thus more receptive to the idea of sexual quid pro quos than women were.
This  result  wasn't  surprising,  but  an  unexpected  finding
was that the two scenarios hardly differed in their pattern of responses. We had expected men to be relatively more willing to trade material rewards for sexual favours, and we had expected women to be relatively more willing to trade sexual favours for materid rewards. However, there was little evidence of this except that women were slightly more willing to give a yes response to the second scenario than to the first.
What were the di4erences in personality between the people
who were willing to make sexual quid pro quos, and those who weren't? The biggest di4erence was in the H factor: of the people who definitely wouldn't do any of the sexual quid pro quos, only

about one-third were below the average level of H. But of the people who probably would do the sexu& quid pro quos, more than three-quarters were below that average level. None of the other HEXACO factors showed any differences nearly as large as this one. Of the six personality dimensions, it's H that best pre- dicts the likelihood of seeking a sexual quid pro quo.

As you can see from our tour through the domains of money, power, and sex, dealing with low-H people is often unpleasant at best. In the next chapter, we'll have some advice for identifying low-H people and for steering around them.

To be able to identify low-H people is a useful skill. If you know who they are, you're better equipped to avoid being exploited by them, whether in the next few minutes or many years down the road. Fortunately, some of the traits that indicate low H	aren't obviously	undesirable,	which means that low-H people won't necessarily even try to conced those aspects of their persondities. If you want a redly accurate idea of a person's level of H,
you will need to observe the whole array of H-related traits as expressed in diverse situations and on many occasions. Only by observing a wide range of the person's behaviour, and appreciating the various contexts in which it occurs, can you have any justified confidence in your assessment. Your first impressions might be mistAen, and it's easy to misdiagnose someone on the basis of a couple of isolated, ambiguous observations, particularly if you're starting with some prejudice (whether positive or negative) toward that person. Having said this, there will be many situations where

you don't have the luxury of time and where your main motive is to avoid being exploited. In those cases it's better to use what information you have and to err on the side of underestimating the person's level of H.
In this chapter, we discuss some signs that can help you iden- tify low-H people, and we o4er some advice for living in a world that contains quite a few of them. But first, we should mention some signs that you might thinL' would mean a person is high in H  but actudly don't.

Not-So-Valid Signs of High H
Respecta6i/ity
The link between respectability and the H	factor is easy to over- estimate. Many people assume that a well-spoken, well-dressed, and well-mannered person must also be well intentioned. These outward signs of respectability probably do indicate a reasonable level of self-control	here is someone who at least understands and can conform to what society considers desirable behaviour. Conversely, if someone is foul-mouthed and rude and generdly scary, that's obviously not a good sign. The problem is that many low-H persons indeed have that reasonable level of self-control (recdl Chapter 4). And some low-H people find that by appearing to be well socialized, it's much easier to take advantage of others. (It's harder to cheat people e4ectively if you look shady to them.) A respectable appearance is not a sure indication of trustworthiness. It's equally unwi5e to take it for granted that every respectable position in society is occupied by a high-H person. If someone

has a respected occupation, a prominent role in their community, and a regular place at religious services, we can again infer that this person probably has a certain amount of self-control. But here the same point applies: many low-H people can navigate social relationships quite successfully, and many low-H people aspire to a position of high status.
Anti-Conformity
Perhaps the flip side of respectability is anti-conformity. By this we mean a calculated effort to be visibly di4erent from others and to bring attention to one's defiance of convention. (This anti- conformity contrasts with the more natural nonconformity of people who happen to be di4erent simply by being themselves.) For example, people who have an unusual style of dress might simply be expressing their personal taste—or they might be acting a4ectedly in an e4ort to appear specid. The point is that anti- conformity isn't the same thing as authenticity and doe5nt neces- sarily indicate a high level of H.
Religious Piety
As we explained in Chapter 8, genuinely religious people tend to be somewhat high in H. But some people who publicly dis- play their religiosity, such a5 by attending religious services or participating in religious rituals, are low-H people who are sim- ply aiming to create an image of respectability and to maintain status within their community. The bottom line is that outward signs of religious commitment aren't a dependable indicator of a high-H personality.

Championing the Underdog
Some people vocally defend the disadvantaged and the oppressed, and many of those people are motivated by a sincere desire to promote social justice. But for some of these champions of the underdog, this role serves merely as a vehicle for obtaining a pos- ition of high status. When you see a prominent defender of the downtrodden, it isn't immediately obvious whether that person is a high-H idedist or a low-H opportunist.
8lunt Criticism
When people criticize, they sometimes sandwich their criticism between slices of self-professed honesty: “I'll be honest with you ... [insert rather hurtful summary of shortcomings here]. I'm just being honest.” Now, sometimes this criticism may be justified; it may even be constructive and meant genuinely for the good of its recipient. But some people use the being-honest gam- bit to make a virtue of their habit of delivering harsh comments. Having a low threshold for criticizing others is not normally an indication of high H. Instead, it's generally an expression of low A and may even suggest a /ou/ level of H, particularly if the intent is really to undermine the listener's self-esteem or their esteem for a third party.
Publicly  Oisplayed  Generosity
On the surface, people who give their wealth away to some worthy cause would seem clearly to be high-H people. But this isn't neces- sarily so. Instead, it depends a lot on whether the acts of philan- thropy are intended for public display. If the donation is highly

visible, being made amid great fanfare and ceremony, then there is no need to invoke a high level of H as a cause of the generosity. Instead, the gik is more accurately viewed as a kind of informal exchange of money for social status. Consider a wealthy person who has more than enough money to enjoy a luxurious lifestyle, but who lacks the esteem and respect of other prominent people. A major donation to (say) a hospitd or a university or a museum or a park will attract a lot of positive attention from the media, from politicians, and from the general public. Thus, even among wealthy people who happen to be low in H, we can expect a great deal of high-profile philanthropy.
In fact, some people who are very low in H are also highly
enthusiastic contributors to charity. You can probably recall at least some cases of people who advertise themselves as philan- thropists, but have also been criminally convicted, usually for white-collar oPences. (If you can't remember any such cases, try searching the Internet with the keywords “philanthropist” and “convicted”.)
Philanthropic acts are much more likely to reflect a high level of H when the donor gives without seeking any attention. Donations made anonymously, or with instructions not to reveal the identity of the donor, are much more consistent with the out- look of high-H persons, because the gi9 is a genuine act of altru- ism rather than simply a purchase of social status.
This doesn't mean that high-profile philanthropy is a sign that the donor has a /oxi level of H. Some wealthy high-H people might feel a certain degree of social pressure to donate money, and they might want to make some publicly visible gi9s in order to

relieve that pressure, beyond any gi9s that they might make (or
might prefer to mAe) privately.
Even when publicly displayed generosity might not be motiv- ated by a high level of H, it can still be beneficial to society. The very fact that social status must be purchased by making worth- while gifis to the public good is encouraging, as it suggests that low-H people must play nice in order to have the respect they crave; they can't simply bully or threaten us all. But then again, if the wedth of the low-H pseudo-philanthropist has been gained dishonestly, the net effect on society will still be negative.

Valid Signs of Low H
Beating the System
It might seem obvious that you shouldn't trust people who tell you—without joking—about various ways of breaking the law. But some people who brag about how to beat the system for example, by evading income taxes or customs duties, or by steal- ing from businesses—may come across as roguishly charming and harmless. And they may rationdize their actions as being not really wrong, because no single person is directly harmed to any significant extent. Don't be fooled: people who will cheat an insti- tution will likely cheat individuals too, and that includes you.
Instrumental Ingratiation
Some people can be very friendly and polite and pleasant—but mainly toward people who have something they want, or who hold some position of influence. Sometimes you can observe this as a third party: consider the player who is attentive to a prospective

conquest until he has sex with her, or the politician who is the best frïend of whichever interest group must be courted next. lt can sometimes be more diŒcult to discern this Ùnd of ingratiation, as we saw in the study of co-workers in Chapter 5: unles5 you know a person very well, ït isn't easy to distinguish flattery from sincère respect, or a4ectation from genuine politeness. The point is sim- ply that people who are selectively nice, reserving their a4ection and compliments for those who are or will be useful to them, are not likely to be loyal friends.
Some low-H individuals say that people who don't act in this way are simply being naive, but in most cases this claim simply reflects their own cynicism. Many people are well aware that they could use fdse ingratiation as a way of getting what they want, and may even feel tempted to do so, but decline as a matter of principle to use such tactics. Apart from redly dictatorial settings, where one's welfare may really depend on the whims of powerful people, the use of ingratiation tactics is largely a function of a low-H personality.
Gambling and Financial Speculation
Gamblers tend to be low in H. More precisely, people who oñen bet a lot of money—at casinos, on sports events, in card games, or whatever—usually have a low level of H, ofien combined with a low level of E. (People who become addicted to gambling are probably dso low in C.)1 The same applies to people whose finan- cid investments amount to short-term speculation, whether on currencies or commodities or real estate or stocks. Of course, many high-H persons will buy a weeHy lottery ticket or play some low-stakes poker, and many high-H persons will invest money in

business ventures that have a real risk of failure. But people who regularly risk a lot of money in gambling or speculation probably have a strong desire to get rich quicHy or to get something for nothing. Such people tend to be low in the H factor, so it's best not to be too trusting of them.
Sexual Infidelity
As we noted in Chapter 9, people who cheat on their romantic partners tend to be low in H, and the same is true of people who try to poach the partners of others. Although such persons will o9en find it wise to be subtle or sneaky in their behaviour, many of them are quite happy to express their cynical outlook on sexual relationships. Moreover, a low-H man is likely to boast about his sexud conquests, and a low-H woman is likely to boast about the material benefits of her relationships or the status of her partners. The point is that people who are sexually unfaithful to their part- ners, or who take an instrumentd approach to sexual relation- ships, are likely to be low in the H factor.
Conspicuous Consumption (and Name Dropping)
A person who displays wealth ostentatiously is trying to signal that he or she is an important, high-status person. But what con- spicuous consumption really signals is a low level of the H factor. Materialistic and ostentatious people tend to be selfish, deceitful, and insincere: people who want more than their share generally feel entitled to have more than their share, and they're willing to take it by force or by fraud, if they judge that they will succeed in doing so. So when someone shows oP a lot of expensive things— home, car, clothing, jewellery, food, drinks—you should be wary

of getting into any business or romantic relationships with that person. The same goes for someone who is readily impressed with such displays and who aspires to match them.
Keep in mind that what matters here is the overall pattern of conspicuous consumption, not merely an isolated extrava- gance or two. For example, a high-H birdwatcher might own an expensive pair of binoculars, a high-H antiques fan might own an expensive old table, and a high-H car enthusiast might own an expensive automobile. But in those cases, the person probably appreciates the item for its intrinsic qualities rather than for its ability to impress other people. In contrast, it's very unlikely that someone would own (or aspire to own) a wide variety of highly visible luxury items out of some intrinsic interest in each of those particular items. Most people who display many di4er- ent kinds of expensive items are expressing a low level of H.
Low-H people sometimes defend greed on the grounds that it motivates hard work and innovation, thereby driving economic progress. (Recall the “greed is good” speech in the 1980s movie Wall Sireer.) Now, it's true that people—even high-H people— generally prefer having more wedth and status rather than less, and that people are less likely to work hard and innovate if there is little reward for productivity. But this doesn't mean that the greediest people—those who most desire money and luxury and power—will be particularly diligent or creative. On the contrary, the consistent finding in personality structure research is that materialistic, social-climbing people are no more hard-working or innovative than everyone else. What's more, greedy people will try to get something for nothing: if they judge that they can get away with it, they're happy to sell you things you don't need, to sell you

things that don't work, and even to sell you things that could kill either you or the worker who made them.
Name dropping is analogous to conspicuous consumption, but the objects of display are social aoliations rather than material goods. Some people will bring your attention to their relationships with famous people or their memberships in prestigious institu- tions. Think of the person who displays photographs of himself or herself with celebrities or politicians, or who tells you all about his or her connections with those persons.
“Above the Law” Menta/ity
Some people decide that they belong to a special class of persons to whom the normal rules should not apply. Their self-appointed membership in this elite may be based on their soci¥ class or eth- nicity, or on what they perceive to be their own superiority of intellect, or attractiveness, or athleticism, or talent, or any other asset. Depending on your own position in the pecking order as they see it (or as they would have you think they see it), they may assure you that you, too, belong to this elite. Don't be seduced by this. When people see themselves as Nietzschean supermen and superwomen who should be exempt from the laws and norms that govern les5er beings, they will also feel quite justified in exploiting the latter in one way or another. You can see this when a high- ranking bureaucrat puts extravagant spending on the govern- ment's tab, or when the board of directors awards its members a bonus at investors' expense. But you also see this when wealthy or famous or high-ranking people are caught shoplifiing (yes, shop- li9ing): they simply feel entitled to take without paying.

Incidentally, the self-appointed supermen and 5uperwomen generally aren't any more super than the rest of us. Even if we put aside their rather less-than-super approach to personal eth- ics, there is not much that is impressive about people who have a strong sense of entitlement: on average, they aren't any tougher or prettier or smarter, and they don't have any more talent or (genuine) charm. The low-H person tends to claim any of his or her personal strengths as proof of entitlement; the high-H person doesn't.
By the way, don't confuse this low-H attitude of entitlement
with mere overconfidence. Some people are inclined to overe5ti- mate their abilities or attributes—say, their intelligence or ath- leticism or attractiveness—without seeing themselves as deserving of speci¥ status. By contrast, low-H people do see themselves as superior beings, but they don't necessarily overestimate their own level of any particular asset.
Contempt of Other Groups
People who are high in H don't necessarily believe that all human groups are equd in every observable characteristic. But high-H people generally do believe that people of every group are deserv- ing of dignity and fair treatment. Thus, when some people take delight in making disparaging comments about other groups, this is a sign of low H. For example, low-H people are more likely than high-H people to make ethnic jokes of any but the most good- natured variety. They're also more likely to mock other groups or to make dehumanizing comments about them.

Living Around Low-H People
What should you do when you realize that someone is probably very low in H? First of all, don't get carried away. It's probably not a good idea to proclaim your diagnosis to others. And it's definitely not a good idea to undertake any vigilante-style action against that person.
The best advice is simply to limit your interaction with people who are low in H. Don't choose them as romantic partners. Don't choose them as business partners. Don't even choose them as ten- nis partners, or as bridge partners. Just stay away from them.
Now, if you're a low-H person yourself, it's not obvious what advice we should give you. On the one hand, high-H people won't try to take advantage of you in the way that low-H people will, so you might be better o4 seeking the company of high-H people. On the other hand, you'll much prefer the approach that your fellow low-H people take in dealing with the world. Probably your best bet is to figure out which low-H people would make the most effective allies in your quest for money and power, and then team up with them. Just be sure to watch them very carefully.
What if you're already in close contact with a low-H person, either professionally or persondly, and can't easily get away? Don't fool yourself into thinking that you can somehow teach a low-H person to appreciate the joys of being fair for the sake of fairness. The better approach is to find ways of Signing your interests with their interests, so that they get what they want by doing what you want. But we realize that it's easier to say this than to do it, and the chdlenge is that the low-H person wiM always be alert to ways of exploiting you. Fortunately, the most serious forms of exploitation

are recognized as crimes, so in the worst situations you should go to the police. As we discussed in Chapter 4, however, low-H people vary a great deal in their potentid for redly crimin&, preda- tory behaviour, depending on their levels of the other personality dimensions. For example, a low-H person who is high in A, C, and E will probably be rather annoying, but he or she is much less likely to be a psychopathic or dangerous person than is someone who combines low levels of these traits with low H.
The flip side of avoiding low-H people is seeking out high-H
people. As we explained in Chapter 6, people tend to form most of their close relationships with those who have similar levels of H and hence have similar values and world views. People gen- er¥ly aren't even aware of this tendency, but if you're a high-H person, you can make a conscious choice to associate with other high-H people. This strategy also applies to places: when deciding where to work or where to live, you can seek out organizations and communities that share the values of high-H people. By gaining the benefits of cooperation with one another, high-H persons can thrive in what ofien seems like a low-H world.

The two of us have been studying the H factor since the late 1990s, and most of the time we treat it simply as a topic of scientific study. But our work on the H factor has made us more aware of our own behaviour. Each of us can look back on his life and recall having acted in some decidedly low-H ways. Although it doesn't feel good to think about those occasions, it does at least make us think about how we ought to act in the future. Already, each of us has o9en behaved a bit differently aher considering how a high- H person would approach a given situation. We haven't achieved anything remotely approaching perfection in this regard, but we do find ourselves trying to be more straightforward and less self- important, more ethical and less materidistic.
Our  own cases help show an important point about the H factor: your level of H doesn't just depend on your genes and on your childhood—it also depends on your own free will. We assume that by nature you're fairly high in H, given that you've already read nearly this whole book. (Most really low-H persons would be turned off long before reaching this chapter.) Now, if

166	Kibeom Lee and Michael C. Ashton

we're right if you're a somewhat high-H person by nature— then you'll very likely accept that being a high-H person is a good thing: you'll believe that being sincere and modest is inherently better than being deceitful and conceited. But unless you're at the extreme high end of the H dimension, you probably feel at least some low-H motivations: maybe you sometimes manipulate others a bit, or give a little less than you redly should, or try to impress others with your status.
Well, if you really do want to be higher in H, you can use your high-H idealism to overcome your low-H inclinations. Even though you have some temptations to deceive or dominate or exploit other people, you can decide to be dert to those tempta- tions and then to resist them. In trying to be higher in H, you might even find it usefiil to follow some specific set of prescrip- tions, whether secular or religious (recall the “Quaker testimon- ies” of Chapter 8). Of course, this kind of conscious choice won't change your “natural” level of H as given by your genes and early experiences. But who cares? Your actual level of H will be higher ju5t the same. Only you will know the di4erence, and this is surely one case where no one will mind being deceived.

The HEXACO Personality Inventory—Revised (HEXACO—PI—R) assesses the six major pcrsonality factors discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. In this Appendix, we provide the short (60-item) version of the HEXACO—PI—R in both self-report and observer report forms. At the end of the Appendix, we provide instructions for scoring and interpreting your responses.

HEXACO-PI-R Scoring and Interpretation
To obtain accurate scores on the HEXACO—PI—R, please com- plete dl of the steps below very carefully. Any errors may greatly distort your results!
	Refer to the sheet containing responses to the HEXACO—PI—R (either self- or observer report). For dl items w@HOUT all asterisk, please copy the response for each item into the adja- cent space (i.e., between parentheses).
	For dl items wiTH an asterisk, please recode the response for each item as follows, and then write the recoded respon5e in the adjacent space (i.e., between parentheses).
1 —> 5;  2 —> 4;  3 —> 3;  4 —• 2;  5 —> 1
After all of the spaces between parentheses have been filled appropriately, find the sum of all numbers in each of the six columns. Then recalculate each sum and resolve any errors.
These column sums represent your scores on six scales of this personality inventory. The scales, from left to right, are as follows:

Openness to Experience (O) Conscientiousness (C) Agreeableness (A) Extraversion (X) Emotiondity (E)
Honesty-Humility (H)
To understand what these scales actually measure, see the descriptions in Table 3—1. This is important, because the scale names alone are not precise descriptions.
Use the following categories to interpret your scores. Note that “above average” is not necessarily better and that “below average” is not necessarily worse; recall the discussions of trade-offs in Chapter 3.
Well above average: 44 or above Somewhat above average:  36 to 43
About average:	28 to 35
Somewhat below average:	20 to 27
Well below average:	19 or below
	Keep in mind that scores on this brief inventory are not perfect indications of personality trait levels. Although the HEXACO—PI—R is a well-validated persondity inventory, the scores of any given person on a particular scale might overestimate or underestimate that person's true level of the personality dimension. For most people, the most accurate information about personality can be gained by considering self-reports in combination with observer reports from people who know that person well.

8 %e Emotion&ity factor of the HEXACO model is similar but not identical to the Big Five Neuroticism factor. We decided that Emotionality was a more accurate label, and it made for a very nice acronym. By the way, don't take the names of the factors too seriously. The names are convenient, but they oversimplify; you can understand the factors better by knowing the traits that belong to them.

Notes to Chapter 3
l Because these strategies are personality dispositions rather than conscious choices, people aren't completely free to change their strategies according to the circumstances they face. Although people can try to adjust their behaviour according to the conditions they encounter, this may be very difhcult (though not impossible) when the behaviour is inconsistent with their personality disposition.
	High-O people tend to know more facts and words than low-O people. But this difference isn't because high-O people are any smarter in general than low-O people. On average, people low in

O are just as good as people high in O at solving diNcult problems in logic or math. But because high-O people tend to read widely and enjoy learning new things, on average they learn more facts and words than low-O people do.
Some researchers have suggested that high O also carries the risk of
developing certain very harmful mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia or other delusiond disorders. However, the link berween O and these disorders is very weak (Ashton & Lee, 2012) and probably contributes very little to the total cost of being high in O.
  Aiello & Wheeler (1995).
These advantages of high C don't have anything to do with intelligence: high-C people aren't any smarter, on average, than low-C people. Now, smarter people—as identified by well-validated IQ tests—do achieve better grades and do perform better on the job, just as high-C people do. But because IQ and C are uncorrelated with each other, we can predict people's school and job performance much better by knowing their levels both of IQ and of C  by knowing either alone. The best performers are high in both C and IQ, and the worst are low in both; people who are high in C but low in IQ, or low in C but high in IQ, are in between.
Gailliot & Baumeister (2007).
Some researchers have suggested that because high-C individu&s aren't impulsive, they lack spontaneity and are too slow in seizing good opportunities. But this suggestion confuses two quite different kinds of impulsivity. The inability  to control  one's impulses  is
associated with low C. But the readiness to seize opportunities is actually associated with high C (at least to a weak extent) and with high X (to a stronger extent); see Dickman (1990).
In case you were wondering,  high-X and low-X individuls can
be described pretty accurately by the common terms “extraverted” and “introverted.”
	This raises the interesting question of how it is that high-X people are viewed as more attractive. Perhaps physically attractive people

tend to develop higher levels of X as a result of the positive social attention they receive. Or  perhaps high-X people are perceived as more attractive because of their vitality and sociability. Or maybe high-X people actually behave in ways that make them more attractive—even in their objective physical appearance—for example, by being more physically active or more interested in improving their appearance.
%e  costs and benefits of being high in X also depend on other
people's levels of this dimension. If most people are low in X, then a high-X person may easily attract friends, allies, and mates. But if most people are high in X, then a high-X person will be only one of many potentially attractive social partnefs. In such a case, the benefits of high X may be too sm&l to justify the energy costs and risks, and people low in X will have an advantage for surviv& and reproduction.
	People sometimes express surprise that traits of honesty and humility go together in the same category. But lack of humility and lack of honesty are part of the same tendency to exploit other people: persons who have a strong sense of superiority and entitlement tend to feel justified in using deceit and manipulation to get what they want from others.
%is  is not to say that high-H people consciously think in terms of
these consequences. A truly high-H person is governed by a sense of person& ethics that makes him or her behave ar if any act of exploiting others would be punished—as it will be, by the person's own conscience—even when there is objectively no chance of being detected or of suffering ret&iation.
For marital satisfaction, see Watson et al. (2004); for heart disease,
see Chida & Steptoe (2009).
Cohen et al. (1996).
Ge costs and benefits of being high or low in A probably depend on the trait levels of other people. What matters here isn't so much the levels of A that other people have, but rather their levels of H.

When many people are low in H, then a low level ofA can be better, because anger and resentment can help protect you from people who are inclined to exploit you. But when people are gener&ly high in H, a high level of A can be better, because it's safe to err on the side of tolerance when you're dealing with people who are basic¥ly fair-minded. Likewise, the costs and benefits of high versus low H also depend on the levels of H that other people have. When almost no one else is low in H, a low-H person may exploit others rather successfully, but when many people are low in H, it may become much harder to do so.

For some other psychological traits—such as intelligence, religious
beliefs, and politicZ attitudes—differences between households do contribute heavily to diYerences between people—but only until adolescence or early adulthood. Apparently, the household in which one is raised will have some influence on one's IQ and beliefs and attitudes, but that influence becomes quite weak añer early adulthood (Plomin & Spinath, 2004). We explore this further in Chapter 7› in discussing politics attitudes.

	For those of you who like numbers, the estimated correlation across this 50-year span is about .60 to .80. Although this vlue is very high,

it also means that at least a few people undergo important changes in personality, relative to their age peers. For example, people who have experienced an episode of major depression—generZly brought about by some crisis in their lives—tend to show larger shi9s in levels of some personality traits, such as Extraversion or Emotionality. See Costa & McCrae (1992b).

	Ashton, Lee, Pozzebon, Visser, & Worth (2010). Note that many forms of risk taking are not status driven, but are motivated instead by the sensations of the experience itself—consider, for example, outdoor adventures such as mountain climbing or deep-sea diving. This kind of adventure seeking depends on several personality factors in combination—low E, high X, high O, and low C, with only a weak element of low H (see, for example, de Vries, de Vries, & Feij, 2009; Lee, Ogunfowora, & Ashton, 2005; Weller & Tikir, 2011).

Other aspects of HEXACO Honesty-Humility and Emotion%ity are not so well accommodated by this questionnaire.

will likely combine low H with low C as well as low E and low
A. But according to forensic psychologists, a few serial killers are particularly orderly and disciplined. Gese so-called “macho man” serial killers (who may appear to function well within military or law enforcement settings) would seem to be extremely low in H and E and A, but rather high in C.

	By the way, there's another objection to the use of self-reports to measure H, although we've never heard anyone mention it: you

could argue that humble people will never claim to be humble in self- report questionnaires, because their very humility will forbid them from doing so. But in fact, high-H people do reved their humility, as for example when they state that they doni consider themselves to be any better or mole deserving than others.

	However, there is one trait within the H factor that doesni show particularly strong agreement between self-reports and observer reports, even when the observer is the spouse. Specifically, people's self-reports of sincerity or straightforwardness—of the tendency not to engage in subtle manipulation, such as flattery or false friendliness—are only modestly correlated with observer reports of these traits. Apparently, people who subtly manipulate others really are subtle about it, to the extent that even their spouses have only a roughly accurate sense of how much they do this.

	It's interesting to speculate about the trait of intelligence in this context of selecting mates. Does it behave like physicd attractiveness (the more, the better), or like religiosity (the more like me, the better)? Studies show that spouses tend to be similar in some but not all aspects of intelligence: they're usually similar in verb& ability (their vocabulary, gener& knowledge, etc.) but not necessarily in mathematical ability. But it isn't clear whether this similarity in verbal  ability  results  from  a competitive  marketplace  situation,

whereby people implicitly try to get someone as verbally smart as they possibly can, or simply from a preference for people similar to oneself. (Either way, it makes sense that spouses would be more similar in verbal ability than in mathematical ability: most couples spend a lot of time in conversation with each other, but only the nerdiest couples would spend any time doing math together.)
Feng & Baker (1994).
	Actually, another way to examine similarity would be to compare Jack's observer report about /ill with Jill's observer report about Jack. This method generally gives results similar to those based on comparisons of self-reports.
Lee, Ashton, Pozzebon, Visser, Bourdage, & Ogunfowora (2009).
As noted earlier, our participant samples consisted mainly of friendship pairs, but there were also many romantic couples, including even a few married couples, as well as some sibling pairs and other pairs of relatives. But because most of our participant pairs consisted of two friends, we'll describe the results here in terms of friendship pairs. The results were generally about the same, by the way, for the romantic couples and for the pairs of relatives.
Schwartz (1992).
	This importance of personal values also helps to explain why perceived similarity is stronger than actual similarity. For example, what matters when /ill forms or maintains a social relationship with /ack is not how similar to her Jack really is, but how similar Jill thinbs Jack is.
Of course, this would depend on that person having a large enough circle of people to choose friends from—it might not work for people living in a small community where the choice of friends is limited.

Note to Chapter 7
Note that this isn't the case for other matters of opinion or taste that lack any element of values. For example, “morning people” and “evening people” are unlikely to feel much discomfort about this

difference between them, nor are “dog people'”and “cat people,” or “tea people” and “coNee people,” and so on.

Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle (1994).
The terms “leh-wing” and “right-wing” have a similar meaning across countries. However, the terms “liber&” and “conservative” differ in meaning between Europe and North America. Here we use the North American meanings, whereby “liberal” and “conservative” are more or less interchangeable with “lefi-wing” and “right-wing,” respectively.

	Some studies indicate a role for the C factor in politic& party support: people higher in C are slightly more likely to favour right- wing political parties. Presumably, the policies typically espoused

by those parties—for example, favouring stricter law enforcement or economic self-reliance—have somewhat weaker appeal to low-C persons, who are more impulsive and less hard working.

Notes to Chapter 8
	Here we'll treat as religions only those ethical or philosophical systems that are based on supernatural beliefs. Note, however, that for some people in modern societies, religion primarily represents a cultural or ethnic aoliation that is now largely independent of any supernatural beliefs—consider, for example, the many secular Jews who retain a strong sense of Jewish identity. Note also that some movements widely viewed as religions do not necessarily involve any supernatur& elements. One example is Confucianism, which provides a way of life without prescribing any particular supernaturZ forces. However, even Confucianism is practised within the traditions of Chinese folk religion, which does include supernaturZ beliefs.
Lee, Ogunfowora, & Ashton (2005).
Saroglou (2010). Saroglou also found that religious people tended to be a bit higher in the C factor—to be more disciplined and organized. This suggests that religions tend to attract and retain high-C people— who presumably are better able to follow the ordered lifestyle that is prescribed by religious teachings—or to promote high-C tendencies in their followers.
Wink, Ciciolla, Dillon, & Tracy (2007).
S Ge tendency for sofi-hearted people to be a bit more religious is true even if we consider either sex alone: soñ-hearted men are slightly more likely to be religious than are hard-hearted men, and the same is true among women.
6 Brooks (2006).
Ge link between religiosity and the H factor in particular shows up in an interesting way in unpublished data from Goldberg's sample of Oregon residents. One of the surveys administered to that sample asked about the respondents' possessions. Among the findings of

that survey was that high-H people tended to own more religious books—such as the Bible—than did low-H people. In contrast, low-H people owned more cellphones, credit cards, and bottles of liquor than did high-H people. The correlations were not very strong, however: many high-H people do own cellphones and credit cards and bottles of liquor and don't own a Bible.

	Note that traditional religious beliefs and mysticd spiritu& beliefs are unrelated to each other—they're not opposite to each other. Some people are both traditionally religious and mystic&ly spiritud and hence accept both Ńnds of supernaturZ beliefs described above. And some people are neither traditionally religious nor mystic&ly spiritual, rejecting &l supernatur% beliefs.
